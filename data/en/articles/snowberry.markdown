Wonderful news for all the fans of classical adventure games: Snowberry Connection and Société Pollene announce that the first three games in the legendary Goblins series are now available to every customer of Gobliiins 4 as a free bonus (only via digital distribution channels: Gamersgate and Impulse).

Playing these games on modern operating systems is made possible by the ScummVM program — the easiest way to enjoy the greatest adventure hits of the past.

Alexander Souslov (Snowberry Connection): "Thanks to ScummVM, thousands of gamers around the world can enjoy the good old Goblins without any compatibility problems and headache"

Max Horn (ScummVM): "Playing the Gobliiins games has been fun over a decade ago, and stil is. ScummVM allows you to enjoy them (and other classics) again on modern hardware, like your smartphone — if you are lucky enough to own them. That's why we at ScummVM are excited to see these gems being re-released to the public, together with the latest installment of this wonderful series. Thanks, Snowberry!"

#### About ScummVM

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!
