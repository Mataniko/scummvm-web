    "content": "ScummVM has just entered a CVS freeze and testing, to prepare for an eventual 0.5.0 stable release (hopefully at the end of July). But we need _YOUR_ help!\n\nPlease click that little 'Documentation' option over there, and look at the [0.5.0 release checklist](http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=release). If there is a game that is listed as needing testing, and you happen to feel like playing it through with the latest development version of ScummVM, please do so and let us know the results. Further information is on the checklist page.\n\nBesides many fixes that will be in the upcoming 0.5.0, especially in the area of music, comes support for three new games:\n\n*   Enhanced Maniac Mansion\n*   Enhanced Zak McKracken\n*   **Beneath a Steel Sky**, thanks to the support of Revolution\n\nIn other news, Anonymous CVS is (and has been for some time) lagging behind the official development tree. If you want the bleeding-edge CVS (for testing, as an example), please use the 'Source Snapshot' on the Download page over Anonymous CVS. And of course,  \n**Be Vigilant**",
