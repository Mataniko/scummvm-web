    "content": "<p>Today we are very happy to announce that Eugene \"sev\" Sandulenko has been elevated to the rank of project leader, meaning we now have a trio at the steering wheel of ScummVM.</p><p>Eugene contributed in major ways to ScummVM, going beyond what could reasonably be expected from a regular team member. He worked on several new engines in ScummVM, the new GUI code, managed several of our releases, played a central role in our recent switch to Subversion, motivates other people to do useful work, and many other things.</p><p>Congratulations, Eugene, and we hope to see a lot more of your great work in the future. :-)</p><br /><p>In other news, the final results of the <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net\">SourceForge.net</a><a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/\">2006 Community Choice Awards</a> are now public, and ScummVM made an honorable second place in the Games category, only beaten by Xbox Media Center (some people are debating how game-like this is, but then, ScummVM itself isn't a game either, so let's not complain :-). Thanks again to everybody who voted for us.</p>",
