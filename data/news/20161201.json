    "content": "The Dude... the Pipe... the Dark-Burrow-Dweller... and you.\n\nAfter several years of development, the ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the obscure, fancy, and engaging adventure game _The Full Pipe_ (Полная Труба in Russian). Grab your Game CD (Android and iOS versions are not supported), the [daily build](/downloads/#daily), and help us test Dude's adventures in the world of Small Fries.\n\nThe game is not available in English, but doesn't have any text other than in the menus. Thus if you don't have the game already you can buy the German version published by [Daedalic Entertainment](http://www.daedalic.de/de/Game/Full_Pipe).\n\nBefore you start your test run, we encourage you to read through our [testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing), and please take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) along the way.\n\nNow, go! The Dude just has fallen into the deep full pipe.",
