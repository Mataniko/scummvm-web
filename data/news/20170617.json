    "content": "Last year, we added support for three of Sierra's Hi-Res Adventure games: _Mystery House_ (#1), _Mission: Asteroid_ (#0) and _Wizard and the Princess_ (#2). We're proud to announce that three more Apple II games are now playable in ScummVM and ready for testing: _Ulysses and the Golden Fleece_ (#4), _Time Zone_ (#5) and _The Dark Crystal_ (#6).\n\nFor _Ulysses and the Golden Fleece_, we currently support the Load 'N' Go budget release. For _Time Zone_ and _The Dark Crystal_ we support the disk images that can be found on some of the [Sierra collection CDs](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCI/Game_Collections). The [Datafiles wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles) has been updated with the required filenames for the disk images.\n\nIf you own one of those classics, grab the latest [daily build](/downloads/#daily) and try it out! If you encounter an issue, please post a bug report following our [testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing). And while you're at it, please take some [screenshots!](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots)\n\nYou may be wondering what happened to _Hi-Res Adventure #3: Cranston Manor_. Unfortunately, we still have not been able to locate a copy of this game after looking for it for over a year. If you own it, we'd love to [hear from you](/contact/)!",
