    "content": "<p>ScummVM 0.6.1 is out, and can now be grabbed from our download page!<br /> Among the usual changes, ScummVM should now run natively on 64-bit machines -- something we actually forgot to mention in the NEWS file.</p><p>And you know what they say: \"To save the world, you have to push a few old ladies down the stairs.\" So we made a mother-load of fixes in this release. Some of the wonderful things you will no LONGER see in ScummVM include:</p><ul><li>Glitches using an Ogg Vorbis talkie file in some games</li><li>Crashes on 64-bit machines</li><li>Crashes when saving to an invalid directory in Broken Sword 1</li><li>Lots of sound glitches in Curse of Monkey Island, Full Throttle and The Dig</li><li>Crashes in some international versions of Simon the Sorcerer</li><li>... and lots of other annoying bugs!</li></ul><p>So don't delay, download today. Downloads are not yet available for all supported ports, such as non-ARM PocketPCs and the HandheldPC binaries. These should become available within the next week.</p>",
