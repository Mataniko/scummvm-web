While Upthorn's project didn't last the summer, we have a pull request which adds much-improved support for saving games to the composer engine.</p><p>The next and final step for this year of GSoC is the mentor summit, where ScummVM will be represented again by sev and Strangerke.</p><p>We'd like to thank once again Google for their organization, their support and for accepting us this year again. ScummVM made a great step forward thanks to them, once again!</p><p>We'd also like to warmly thank Jakimushka, Singron, Somaen and Upthorn for working this summer with us, with a special mention for Somaen who decided to keep working for ScummVM on Wintermute. We hope that some of the others might do so too!</p>",
