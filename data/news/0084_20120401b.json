I'm proud to announce the <b>new</b> ScummVM rewrite in C# for Windows Phone 7 and Xbox 360 ports. This does not include any of the previous \"ScummVM-XNA\" code and is all new code based on our current working tree.</del></p><p><del>The Windows Phone 7 port has been the main target of our work as I'm more familiar with the touchscreen controls.

Since going through each engine is very tedious work, I've only worked on the engine I'm most familiar with: Groovie. And, I think the <a href=\"/data/news/20120401_6.jpg\">results speak for themselves</a>.</del></p><p><del>I'll have the source code up on GitHub soon, but here's <a href=\"/data/news/20120401_7.png\">a brief snippet</a> of some working converted C# code.</del></p>",
