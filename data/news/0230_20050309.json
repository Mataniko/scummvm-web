    "content": "<p>I guess it's time for the usual, regular, monthly sign of life, <em>\"Yes, we are alive. No, we still won't merge with FreeSCI. Yes, you can donate your Ferrari to me, I might reconsider then.\"</em><br /> As usual, lots of small and big things happened, we might post some info in the not too distant future. In the meantime, I'd like to set a spotlight on a small but nifty detail, maybe it'll be of interest/use to some of you...:</p><p>Some time ago, we added a <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=bootparam\">list of boot params</a> to our documentation section. Maybe you have already noticed it, if not, check it out.</p><p>In case you don't know what a boot param is (shame on you!), I actually tried to explain it <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=bootparam\">on that page</a>, so, have a look anyway ;-). If you think the explanation is not clear enough, drop me a line and tell me how to improve it.</p><p>And if you really want to feel cool, you can even contribute a bit here and help us out by filling in some of the gaps in our boot param tables. Once again, see <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=bootparam\">the boot param page</a> for more information.</p>",
