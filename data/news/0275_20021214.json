    "content": "I forgot to mention this when we released 0.3.0b, but ScummVM has recently been spotted in a UK magazine: <i>PC Zone</i> mentioned ScummVM in a review of the iPAQ 3870. A <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/media/pczone.jpg\">page scan</a> is available. In addition, the german computer magazine <a href=\"http://www.heise.de/ct/\">c't</a> had an article about games for PDAs which also listed Pocket Scumm (sorry, no picture available right now). <br /><br /> Monkey in your pocket? Definitely. <br /><br /> If anybody else notices ScummVM in the media, we would appreciate it you dropped us a line at <a href=\"mailto:press_stuff@scummvmNOSPAM.org\">press_stuff@scummvmNOSPAM.org</a>. Remove the NOSPAM from the address, obviously. If possible, please also send us a scan of the page. <br /><br /> If you <b>work</b> for a magazine that wants to mention ScummVM, maybe in an article on retro-gaming (*hint hint*), then also feel free to drop us a line. We can probably arrange an interview, screenshots, help... and/or large bribe-like quantities of bananas.",
