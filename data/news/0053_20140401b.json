Unfortunately, we haven't really got a new developer... though pull requests are welcome!</b></p><p><s>We do not normally announce new developers here, but we have an unusual and talented developer recently join the team, Edward Snowden.</s></p><p><s>When we first got the e-mail from a dot-ru address which we will not be disclosing, we were skeptical.</s></p><p><s>However upon verifying his PGP key, we are convinced that this is not some kind of April Fools joke and are happy to welcome a talented software developer with enthusiasm to the team.</s></p><p><s>He is apparently a big fan of point and click adventures, especially <i>Beneath a Steel Sky,</i>, <i>Dreamweb</i>, <i>Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth</i>, and <i>I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</i>. His collection allowed him to pass a long stopover at an airport last year and he decided then, once he had sorted some personal issues to get around to contributing some code to ScummVM.</s></p><p><s>As an avid fan of Larry Niven, he will be initially working on the TSaGE support for <i>Return to Ringworld</i> along with Strangerke, and will be using the nickname \"crazyeddie\"</s></p><p><s>Please can we ask the other developers and users not to bother him about any issues outside of ScummVM and not to send any irrelevant e-mails to his ScummVM address at \"crazyeddie@scummvm.org\" Thanks!</s></p>",
