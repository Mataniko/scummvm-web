Don't expect it to do anything (in fact it is disabled in the 0.4.0 release, but you can get it by compiling ScummVM yourself).\n*   Even more pre-alpha support for enhanced versions of V2 SCUMM games (Maniac Mansion and Zak)\n*   Preliminary support for early Humongous Entertainment titles (very experimental)\n*   New debug console and several GUI/Launcher enhancements\n*   New Save/Load code (easier to expand while retaining compatibility)\n*   Dreamcast port now works with new games added for 0.3.0b\n*   New official PalmOS port\n*   Various minor and not so minor SCUMM game fixes\n*   Large memory leak fixed for The Dig/COMI\n*   SMUSH code optimised, frame dropping added for slower machines\n*   Code cleanups\n\nThe source code, as well as binaries for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, PocketPC, Solaris and PalmOS are already available at our [download page](/downloads/). Other binaries for MorphOS, Dreamcast and others, will follow shortly.\n\n_We hope you will enjoy the best ScummVM ever!_",
