Or so we hear from <a href=\"http://games.slashdot.org/games/05/08/03/1641224.shtml?tid=207&amp;tid=202&amp;tid=203\">Slashdot</a>, which seems to have brought his site to its knees :)</p><p>Please note, however, that the Nintendo DS port mentioned is not yet an official or supported port. So please don't contact us about it, because we can't help :)</p><p>The contents of Rons latest post has been quoted in <a href=\"http://humaninbox.blogspot.com/2005/08/ron-gilbert-supports-illegitimate.html\">this blogspot post</a>. For the record, we've given Ron the nod in our readme.txt since Wed Apr 17 17:31:05 2002 (UTC).</p><p>We're also calling for testers to report problems with <a href=\"http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ite/\">'Inherit the Earth'</a> (details and purchase information behind the link!). Please use the bug tracker, and set the correct game under Group. Please only test with the <b>latest</b> CVS version. Thanks!</p>",
