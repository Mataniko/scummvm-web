To be honest, while we hope it is possible, we are dubious that the deal LucasArts may provide can give us certain freedoms we need to develop.

Unfortunately, if LEC feels the same way, we may have to reject their offer. It is close on impossible to relicense GPLed software, as it would mean getting permission from anyone who ever wrote even one line of code included in ScummVM.<br /><br /> So far most of our communication has been off-the-record and fairly vague, but be assured we haven't vanished, and we'll give you the latest news as it happens! <br /><br /> Also, thanks to people donating.

No, ScummVM is not currently in any kind of position to start supporting OTHER non-SCUMM games.

Please enjoy this release as much as we've became frustrated making it, and remember - if you give all your money to LucreArts, maybe they'll let us live instead of abandoning us on... on.... Monkey Island! (Ugh, Bananas... I hate Bananas). <br /><br /> For those interested in the boring news, here's both a summary and an update on our legal situation, for those users who are just now discovering ScummVM. <hr /><i>We've been at a deadlock with LucasArts for some time now. LucasArts simply do not like our current license, the GPL (General Public License). While we do not think it necessary, we have agreed to change the license to something more LucasArts-'friendly'. However, LucasArts wish us to include distribution terms which are against section one of both the <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines\">Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html\">Open Source Definition</a>. We cannot agree to this, nor the condition they wish to require (no commercial distribution)... because it conflicts with the DFSG and OSD, which we require, and it is something we legally cannot be sure of enforcing - several Linux and BSD distributions already include ScummVM packages, and we cannot be certain they will notice a license change. Oh, and we WANT distributions to be able to include our software :) <br /><br /> To date, LucasArts has not been able to give us any firm complaints regarding ScummVM, besides some vague claims that if they didn't enforce these conditions on us, it would effectively give up their rights to their own Intellectual Property. We do not believe this, there certainly have not been any documented cases of the GPL leading to such a challenge in the past, and far more important properties have been licensed under the GPL in the past, such as the Quake titles from <a href=\"http://www.idsoftware.com/\">id software</a>. LucasArts isn't releasing any of their own code under the GPL, and we really do not believe that they should require us to change our license - all we want them to do is leave us alone to create our emulator. Sanction us, if it makes them feel safer legally. But if they are going to require such a major step on our part of changing our license, they at least have to capitulate on the point of OSD/DFSG compliance. <br /><br /> We here at the ScummVM team would like to thank the people at LucasArts who are supporting us, and attempting to help us come to an arrangement. But guys, we're your fans. All we are doing is updating the engine for games, in a form of an emulator... because you haven't - although we've asked you to for years. We've even made more money for you, as quite a number of us have went out and BOUGHT your classic bundle packs, just to play it with ScummVM. </i><br /><br /><div align=\"center\"><b>These last few paragraphs have been brought to you by the \"Please don't sue us for making a new release\" department.</b></div>"

        "content": "We here on the ScummVM team hope everybody had a good Christmas! <br /><br /> First we would like to mention that LucasArts has put out a pack, at least in the UK, featuring updated versions of Sam and Max and Full Throttle, designed to work with Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2K/XP. This pack (entitled, imaginatively, \"The Entertainment Pack\") also comes with The Dig and Grim Fandango... these versions have not been updated, and are the original Windows versions (yes, these games DID come with native Windows ports in some of the earlier LucasArts Adventure Packs). <br /><br /> The updated Sam and Max and Full Throttle engines were not ported in-house by LucasArts, likely because of a lack of time AND because most people who worked on SPUTM/SCUMM have left anyway, but by Aaron Giles - the original Mac Porter (and renown MAME developer :). There are no modifications except for a DirectX wrapper around the graphics code and a really really bad graphics scaler. <br /><br /> Our take? Call us biased, but unless you <i>need</i> perfect compatibility, want to play Full Throttle now, or are missing more than two of these games - it will probably be far cheaper to buy these games second-hand or individually. The included updated binaries are inferior feature-wise to ScummVM, as you miss out on our enhanced features, such as support for platforms -other- than Windows (such as Macintosh, Unix and PocketPC), our graphics scalers, etc. Of course, if you do purchase the pack, the game datafiles are unchanged and of course compatible with ScummVM anyway. It <i>is</i> nice to see LucasArts releasing something like this, and doing something positive to try and revive their classic games - or at least drum up marketing hype for the sequel :) <br /><br /> Final conclusion, buy it if you want it or are a collector - but it's not worth the money simply for Windows compatibility. However if you do purchase it, you ARE encouraging LucasArts to update more classics in the future - although hopefully ScummVM will make such a need obsolete shortly. We suggest LucasArts spend it's development costs on re-releasing it's lost and RARE classics, like the FmTowns 256 color version of Zak Mckracken. For those interested, the updated versions were compiled on October 2nd for Full Throttle, and October 24th for Sam and Max. <br /><br /> In development news, several ScummVM developers have actually been really boring people and <i>coded</i> this Christmas, coming up over just a few days with the basics for Curse of Monkey Island support. I'm sure our Macintosh users will be happy to hear they will, in maybe as little as a month, finally be able to play this game. Support is in the latest CVS and Daily Builds, but <b>do NOT file bug reports</b> as we know it doesn't really work or do anything at the moment. Full support will be available \"When It's Done\".. or the day after Duke Nukem Forever comes out. Whichever is first. <br /><br /> Ho Ho Ho!"

This is somewhat of an open plea, although we do not really expect morons who have done something so idiotic to listen. <br /><br /> Sorry for this open message being so harsh guys, but do you not realise that by associating and bundling ScummVM <b>with</b> pirated copies (\"Abandonware\" or otherwise) of LucasArts games, you're basically giving them even more excuse to take legal action against us (and bring possible financial ruin on the developers of this program :)... I'm especially disappointed in chrilith who has almost certainly guaranteed that, unless we feel very forgiving, there will never be an official Palm port of ScummVM integrated into CVS. <br /><br /> If you appreciate what we are doing, and have done, then do not abuse it. Otherwise you are damaging the reputation, and possible legal status of both ScummVM and its developers. I've seen some VERY ridiculous comments on the Clie Source forums to the effect that LucasArts do not sell these games anymore. With the exception of some versions (specifically Zak256 and LoomCD), this is stupid. Most LucasArts games can be ordered in collection packs from Amazon or the LucasArts store (if you live in America.). Heck, I saw a bunch of LucasArts classic adventures in Electronic Boutique when I was Christmas Shopping. <hr /> In other news, Curse of Monkey Island support is progressing nicely! Be sure to try out the latest Daily Builds if you like living on the wild side (but of course do not file bug reports on CMI support)."

Within just several weeks, remarkable progress has been made on support for this game, but work will likely be slowed for the next week as various developers are otherwise occupied. Currently, except for some bugs that make the Cannon scene rather difficult and unstable, it is possible to play some way into Part II of the game. <br /><br /> The current main issues remaining include a bug with flObject allocation (causes a crash in some dialog sequences), some script termination issues (causes various game-crippling crashes in the cannon scene and several Part II puzzles) and the various problems with the opening cannon puzzle. <br /><br /> As usual, please remember this work is still experimental, and please do not file any bug reports regarding it.

While there are still a number of small graphical glitches, currently we are down to two known gameplay-critical bugs and a number of other 'inconveniences' and cases of incorrect behavior. We hope to be able to announce Curse of Monkey Island completable very soon. <br /><br /> A lot of people have been asking where we are going from here. Here is a brief (very subject to change!) guide to our next few targets:<ul><li>February 2003: Curse of Monkey Island completable</li><li>Feb - Mar 2003: Regression testing/bugfixes for other supported games</li><li>Feb - Mar 2003: Completion of the Launcher functionality (tabbed option dialogs, etc)</li><li>Early March 03: CVS Freeze, Regression testing, 0.4.0 release</li><li>March onwards: V1/V2 game support (Maniac Mansion, non-FmTowns Zak, EGA Loom, etc.)</li></ul><br /><br /> As usual, this is but a rough guideline depending on both progress and free time for our developers. If you want to help, and know how to use CVS and a compiler... either fix bugs, or regression test! We are very much looking for people to test CVS with games other than ComI and look for critical bugs that were not present in 0.3.0b, then attempt to try different versions of CVS and locate at least the day when the bug started occurring. This allows us to more easily determine what changes have caused problems, without spending weeks blindly guessing. <br /><br /> Needless to say, if you find a critical bug that IS also present in 0.3.0b, check for a bug report. If one isn't present, please submit one!"

There have also been dramatic fixes and improvements in the area of sound and music, as well as a greatly improved game management/options screen and two new graphics modes (HQ2x and HQ3x). Most importantly, we have also added new support for the following games:</p><ul><li>The classic V1 versions of the original LucasArts SCUMM games Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken and the LucasArts SCUMM game 'Full Throttle'</li><li>Broken Sword 1 and Broken Sword 2.

This new project will unite the strengths and capabilities of the projects involved, creating what the project members believe will be a revolution for adventure game fans around the globe.</p><p>When asked about the relevance of CABAL for the worldwide adventure gaming market, ScummVM project lead Max Horn commented that \"[with] the market for adventure titles waning, we believe that the formation of a project with the explicit goal of running every adventure game ever released will infuse it with new life.\" FreeSCI maintainer Lars Skovlund added that \"this will certainly cause an upheaval in the gaming world. Adventure game fans around the world, rejoice!\".</p><p>In addition to supporting LucasArts' SCUMM games (including famous titles such as \"Monkey Island\", \"Indiana Jones\" and \"Sam and Max\"), Sierra's SCI and AGI lines (\"King's Quest\", \"Leisure Suit Larry\", \"Space Quest\"...), and other games already supported by the retrospective engines, the newly united team plans to continue to add further titles to their already impressive list.</p>Some of the juicy new modules include:<ul><li>An Infocom module (based on the <a href=\"http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz/\">Frotz Z-machine interpreter</a>), so you can now play your favorite text adventures anywhere you go!</li><li><a href=\"http://exult.sourceforge.net\">Exult</a> is being merged in as a plugin, allowing Ultima 7 fans around the world to play their favorite game on the many platforms already supported by the CABAL component engines - including Palm/PocketPC PDAs and the Dreamcast.</li><li>Revolution software has offered the source-code for Broken Sword 3, which will be added to the titles supported by the upcoming CABAL3D project - alongside with Grim Fandango and, possibly, Ultima IX (negotiations are ongoing).</li><li>Support for the SNES games Final Fantasy IV through VI (Japanese numbering, i.e. FF2/FF3 according to US releases) is planned for sometime this Fall. Whilst these are not strictly adventure games, the storyline and plots in this series are more imaginative than any 'action adventure' title published in recent years.</li></ul><p>Offers by various companies, including Microsoft and Amiga International, to buy out the team have been gently but firmly declined by the leads of the joint project. \"We know that we could earn a lot of money from this, but we are idealists and at this time we have the goal to reform the worlds adventure market. Once that is achieved, we can reconsider about making some money out of this.\"</p>"

Regarding the other parts, we'll see...</li><li>Thanks to the hard work of some dedicated people we also finally support the (in)famous <span style=\"color:#008000;\">NES version of Maniac Mansion</span>. Wow, that should be about the last LucasArts SCUMM game we were not supporting ... ;-)</li><li>Support for <span style=\"color:#008000;\">Humongous Entertainment's kids games</span> is progressing well, the following titles can be completed with the current development version of ScummVM:<ul><li>Freddi Fish 1 - 4</li><li>Pajama Sam 1 &amp; 2</li><li>Putt-Putt (several titles)</li><li>Spy Fox 1 &amp; 2</li><li>Several arcade titles</li></ul></li></ul><b>New thumbs</b><ul><li>No, I didn't undergo plastic surgery (although another pair of thumbs sounds tempting...).

In case you wonder, a versioning system is a tool for collaborative software development.

Working on a project on this scale just would not be possible without the help of such a system.</p><p>From the very beginning, Ludvig Strigeus committed his initial ScummVM version to CVS, the versioning system we used until recently. Vincent Hamm joined him shortly thereafter. Since then, a lot has changed, many things have happened. We have more than 20,000 revisions of ScummVM and its various components in our CVS repository.</p><p>We now moved to a new system, Subversion. Compared to CVS, it adds many useful new features, that allow us to work more efficiently on ScummVM, something we are sure all our users will appreciate. Among other things, there will be no more lag between anonymous and developers version of the source code -- you get everything we do instantly!</p><p>If you used a CVS checkout so far, scrap it, install a <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html\">Subversion client</a> and checkout</p><pre> https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ </pre><p>If you are using the command line subversion client, that means you simply have to type the following command:</p><pre> svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ scummvm </pre><p>You will notice that the source tree of ScummVM already changed significantly and yet more is to come.

We were contacted by someone who offered us a direct lead to Emilio de Paz from Alcachofa Soft, S.L., the software house that created this game in 1996. Finally in July '07 we received the sources and a few months later they finally freewared it and gave us an official permission distribute the game.</p><p>The original version of the game is in Spanish with full voice overs and subtitles. Then there exists an English version with full voice overs and subtitles, and finally there are subtitles in German, French and Italian. Of course, there is also a full musical score which came as a set of audio tracks on the CD (the game was CD-only). We improved the English and Italian translations, and made all that was mentioned here ready for <a href=\"/downloads/\">download</a>.</p><p>In order to play the game you will need at least the English pack. Then you may optionally download the music pack, and the international pack which contains all those additional languages, Spanish included.</p><p>We hope that this will really extend the lifetime of the game and wish the best to <a href=\"http://www.alcachofasoft.com/\">Alcachofa Soft</a>.</p>"

Yes, truly, it took us just 6.5 years, and today we are eagerly announcing that a universal adventure game interpreter, playing SCUMM, AGI, and <b>SCI</b> games has been released.</p><p>From now on, it is available on ScummVM's <a href=\"/downloads/\">downloads page</a> (Look for version 1.2.0). You may jump straight there, or stay a bit longer and see what cool new features are included.</p><p>As you have probably already realized, this release has support for SCI, and moreover, <a href=\"/compatibility/1.2.0/\">the list of compatible</a> games goes beyond the original FreeSCI which was merged about 1.5 years ago. We support <i>Conquests of Camelot/the Longbow</i>, <i>Castle/Island of Dr. Brain</i>, <i>Codename: ICEMAN</i>, <i>EcoQuest 1&amp;2</i>, <i>all four Hoyle games</i>, <i>Freddy Pharkas</i>, <i>Jones in the Fast Lane</i>, <i>King's Quest I-VI</i>, both <i>Laura Bow</i> games, <i>Larry</i> up to 6 (low-res 6 only), <i>Police Quest 1-3</i>, <i>Quest for Glory I-III</i>, <i>Space Quest up to V</i> and a few others. Incredible work by the FreeSCI team and our own SCI engine team!</p><p>Early SCI 16-color games can be optionally undithered by ScummVM, making them look much better. To see a comparison between undithered graphics and the original, watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FScrBr16vkM\">this video</a> produced by one of our SCI engine developers and see for yourself.</p><p>Besides SCI, we have added support for yet another Coktel Vision game called <i>Fascination</i> and we have a number of new ports: Android, Dingux, Caanoo and OpenPandora. Unfortunately we had to declare the PalmOS port officially dead.</p><p>As usual there are tons of engine-specific bug fixes. Take a look at the <a href=\"/frs/scummvm/1.2.0/ReleaseNotes\">release notes</a> if you want to know more. But wait! We would like to tell a little bit about another long-awaited feature new in this release. After all these years we are finally going international, and the ScummVM GUI can be translated into any language (well, almost any). Right now we have Catalan, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian localizations. Besides this there are a lot of smaller improvements like tooltips, radio buttons, improved usability and we support more games running from original media without the need to shuffle the game files.</p><p>Enough talking! Now it is time to <a href=\"/downloads/\">download</a> ScummVM and start playing!</p>"

ScummVM 1.8.1 is now available with fixes for important bugs and support for even more platforms.</p><p>One of the most important \"features\" of this release is a major upgrade to the Android port. This upgrade also adds support for the OUYA console. We are currently working on bringing this new release straight to Google Play, but for the impatient among you, feel free to go ahead and <a href=\"/downloads\">install the APKs manually</a>. The Android port now comes in two flavours, our \"classic\" OpenGL-based one, and a new variant based on SDL. The SDL port has better compatibility with some Android devices and also works better with some engines.

Keep your eyes peeled!</p><p>64-bit Mac binaries now include experimental automatic update checking using <a href=\"https://sparkle-project.org/\">Sparkle</a>. Auto-updating is selected as an opt-in during your first start up, and by default checks weekly for new releases.

All the details on how the update process works can be found <a href=\"https://sparkle-project.org/\">here</a>.</p><p>No ScummVM release would be complete without game engine updates!

Translation templates are updated automatically when needed, and so is the binary translation data file. Translators now just have to translate. That's it. The website also helps translators by performing automated quality checks and suggesting (machine) translations.</p><p>Finally, the new site also adds a community aspect to translations, enabling users to vote for suggested translations and even make their own suggestions. Anybody can view the translations, but you will need to log in to make suggestions, comment, and vote. You can log in using your GitHub or Facebook account, or by creating an account on the website. You will still need to contact us if you want to contribute further (for example to start a new translation or help on an existing one), as we will need to grant you access to the Translators group. Unlike regular users, translators can accept or reject suggestions and modify translations directly. Contact us by visiting the #scummvm IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:translation@scummvm.org\">translation@scummvm.org</a> if you are interested in becoming an official translator.

This is obviously a problem for potential contributors, as well as potential GSoC students wanting to reverse engineer an old adventure game or RPG for their project. The obvious solution is to provide an earlier freeware version that still supports them.</p><p>Consulting with Hex-Rays, they're kindly consented for us to host one of the earlier IDA freeware versions, for those in the future who wish to use it. After reviewing the earlier versions, we've settled on <a href=\"https://www.scummvm.org/frs/extras/IDA/idafree50.exe\">IDA Freeware Version 5.0</a>. IDA 5.0 was the first version of IDA that added the convenient graph view, and this freeware version has both it as well as the ability to disassemble DOS executables. It's also not time limited like the demo versions, it's the most convenient for enthusiasts to try their hand at reverse engineering old games.</p><p>Considering how many of our game engines have been created by reverse engineering the original games, hopefully we will continue to see people interested in re-implementing games in the future.</p><p>The more the merrier :)</p>"

The accepted proposals will be announced on May 6, and there will be a few weeks for community bonding before the start of the coding period on May 27.</p><p>In any case, don't hesitate to chat with us on IRC! #scummvm and #residualvm in the Freenode network are the place to go!</p>"

It's been 10 years since we introduced the \"Modern Theme\" to ScummVM. </p><p>After all those years, it surely was time for an update.</p><p>Over the last couple of weeks, ScummVM team member mataniko carefully updated the theming of ScummVM. The new theme follows modern design principles while preserving our own design philosophy.</p><p>From now on, future versions of ScummVM <a href=\"https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html\">(including current nightly builds!)</a> will include the new theme by default.</p><p>Already missing the old theme? Don't worry! The old \"ScummVM Modern\" theme can be selected in ScummVM's options at any time.</p><p> What do you think about the new theme? <a href=\"https://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=14850&amp;p=87219\">Let us know in our forums!</a> As always, your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>"
