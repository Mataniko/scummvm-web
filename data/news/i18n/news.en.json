The wait is over. No, we haven't reached a settlement, we just got tired of waiting to release this gem.  \r\n  \r\nThere have been hundreds, if not thousands, of bugfixes since our last 0.2.0 release... not to mention support for at least three new games (The VGA version of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and support for The Dig and Simon the Sorcerer 2)... and new features such as a vastly improved in-game gui and a built-in launcher to make it even easier for you to add, configure, and run your classic LucasArts (and AdventureSoft) games.

Monkey Island! (Ugh, Bananas... I hate Bananas).  \r\n  \r\nFor those interested in the boring news, here's both a summary and an update on our legal situation, for those users who are just now discovering ScummVM.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n_We've been at a deadlock with LucasArts for some time now. LucasArts simply do not like our current license, the GPL (General Public License). While we do not think it necessary, we have agreed to change the license to something more LucasArts-'friendly'. However, LucasArts wish us to include distribution terms which are against section one of both the [Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)](http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and the [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html). We cannot agree to this, nor the condition they wish to require (no commercial distribution)... because it conflicts with the DFSG and OSD, which we require, and it is something we legally cannot be sure of enforcing - several Linux and BSD distributions already include ScummVM packages, and we cannot be certain they will notice a license change. Oh, and we WANT distributions to be able to include our software :)  \r\n  \r\nTo date, LucasArts has not been able to give us any firm complaints regarding ScummVM, besides some vague claims that if they didn't enforce these conditions on us, it would effectively give up their rights to their own Intellectual Property. We do not believe this, there certainly have not been any documented cases of the GPL leading to such a challenge in the past, and far more important properties have been licensed under the GPL in the past, such as the Quake titles from [id software](http://www.idsoftware.com/). LucasArts isn't releasing any of their own code under the GPL, and we really do not believe that they should require us to change our license - all we want them to do is leave us alone to create our emulator. Sanction us, if it makes them feel safer legally. But if they are going to require such a major step on our part of changing our license, they at least have to capitulate on the point of OSD/DFSG compliance.  \r\n  \r\nWe here at the ScummVM team would like to thank the people at LucasArts who are supporting us, and attempting to help us come to an arrangement. But guys, we're your fans. All we are doing is updating the engine for games, in a form of an emulator... because you haven't - although we've asked you to for years. We've even made more money for you, as quite a number of us have went out and BOUGHT your classic bundle packs, just to play it with ScummVM._  \r\n  \r\n\r\n**These last few paragraphs have been brought to you by the \"Please don't sue us for making a new release\" department.**"

        "content": "We here on the ScummVM team hope everybody had a good Christmas!  \r\n  \r\nFirst we would like to mention that LucasArts has put out a pack, at least in the UK, featuring updated versions of Sam and Max and Full Throttle, designed to work with Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2K/XP. This pack (entitled, imaginatively, \"The Entertainment Pack\") also comes with The Dig and Grim Fandango... these versions have not been updated, and are the original Windows versions (yes, these games DID come with native Windows ports in some of the earlier LucasArts Adventure Packs).  \r\n  \r\nThe updated Sam and Max and Full Throttle engines were not ported in-house by LucasArts, likely because of a lack of time AND because most people who worked on SPUTM/SCUMM have left anyway, but by Aaron Giles - the original Mac Porter (and renown MAME developer :). There are no modifications except for a DirectX wrapper around the graphics code and a really really bad graphics scaler.  \r\n  \r\nOur take? Call us biased, but unless you _need_ perfect compatibility, want to play Full Throttle now, or are missing more than two of these games - it will probably be far cheaper to buy these games second-hand or individually. The included updated binaries are inferior feature-wise to ScummVM, as you miss out on our enhanced features, such as support for platforms -other- than Windows (such as Macintosh, Unix and PocketPC), our graphics scalers, etc. Of course, if you do purchase the pack, the game datafiles are unchanged and of course compatible with ScummVM anyway. It _is_ nice to see LucasArts releasing something like this, and doing something positive to try and revive their classic games - or at least drum up marketing hype for the sequel :)  \r\n  \r\nFinal conclusion, buy it if you want it or are a collector - but it's not worth the money simply for Windows compatibility. However if you do purchase it, you ARE encouraging LucasArts to update more classics in the future - although hopefully ScummVM will make such a need obsolete shortly. We suggest LucasArts spend it's development costs on re-releasing it's lost and RARE classics, like the FmTowns 256 color version of Zak Mckracken. For those interested, the updated versions were compiled on October 2nd for Full Throttle, and October 24th for Sam and Max.  \r\n  \r\nIn development news, several ScummVM developers have actually been really boring people and _coded_ this Christmas, coming up over just a few days with the basics for Curse of Monkey Island support. I'm sure our Macintosh users will be happy to hear they will, in maybe as little as a month, finally be able to play this game. Support is in the latest CVS and Daily Builds, but **do NOT file bug reports** as we know it doesn't really work or do anything at the moment. Full support will be available \"When It's Done\".. or the day after Duke Nukem Forever comes out. Whichever is first.  \r\n  \r\nHo Ho Ho!"

Otherwise you are damaging the reputation, and possible legal status of both ScummVM and its developers.

If you want to help, and know how to use CVS and a compiler... either fix bugs, or regression test! We are very much looking for people to test CVS with games other than ComI and look for critical bugs that were not present in 0.3.0b, then attempt to try different versions of CVS and locate at least the day when the bug started occurring. This allows us to more easily determine what changes have caused problems, without spending weeks blindly guessing.  \r\n  \r\nNeedless to say, if you find a critical bug that IS also present in 0.3.0b, check for a bug report.

ScummVM is a graphic adventure game interpreter designed to allow users to play many classic adventure game titles on various computer systems; (Linux, Windows 2000/XP, \\*BSD, Mac OS X, PocketPC/Handheld PC, Palm, Dreamcast and more)\r\n\r\nVersion 0.6.0 brings with it a new milestone in ScummVM history, with all LucasArts/LucasFilm SCUMM adventure titles now being supported. We are also proud to announce in conjunction with ScummVM 0.6.0 the release of the classic adventure game 'Flight of the Amazon Queen' (originally available for the Amiga and DOS) as freeware. The ScummVM team would like to thank the authors Steve Stamatiadis and John Passfield for providing the team with the source code to this classic game, and allowing us to release it.\r\n\r\nSo, what's new?\r\n\r\nScummVM 0.6.0 includes, as usual, many bugfixes in all supported game engines. There have also been dramatic fixes and improvements in the area of sound and music, as well as a greatly improved game management/options screen and two new graphics modes (HQ2x and HQ3x). Most importantly, we have also added new support for the following games:\r\n\r\n*   The classic V1 versions of the original LucasArts SCUMM games Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken and the LucasArts SCUMM game 'Full Throttle'\r\n*   Broken Sword 1 and Broken Sword 2. Many thanks to Revolution for providing us with the source-code to these games.\r\n*   Support for Flight of the Amazon Queen. Thanks to Steve and John for providing us with the source code to this game, and permitting its release as freeware.\r\n\r\nScummVM 0.6.0, the two freeware games Flight of the Amazon Queen and Beneath a Steel Sky, as well as converted cutscenes required for playing Broken Sword 1 and Broken Sword 2 may be downloaded from the [Download Page](/downloads/)"

        "content": "April 1st, THE INTERNET: The [FreeSCI](http://freesci.org/), [Sarien](http://sarien.sourceforge.net/) and [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org/) teams today announced the formation of CABAL (Coalesced 'Adventures beyond Architecture' League), a universal adventure game interpreter. This new project will unite the strengths and capabilities of the projects involved, creating what the project members believe will be a revolution for adventure game fans around the globe.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the relevance of CABAL for the worldwide adventure gaming market, ScummVM project lead Max Horn commented that \"\\[with\\] the market for adventure titles waning, we believe that the formation of a project with the explicit goal of running every adventure game ever released will infuse it with new life.\" FreeSCI maintainer Lars Skovlund added that \"this will certainly cause an upheaval in the gaming world. Adventure game fans around the world, rejoice!\".\r\n\r\nIn addition to supporting LucasArts' SCUMM games (including famous titles such as \"Monkey Island\", \"Indiana Jones\" and \"Sam and Max\"), Sierra's SCI and AGI lines (\"King's Quest\", \"Leisure Suit Larry\", \"Space Quest\"...), and other games already supported by the retrospective engines, the newly united team plans to continue to add further titles to their already impressive list.\r\n\r\nSome of the juicy new modules include:\r\n\r\n*   An Infocom module (based on the [Frotz Z-machine interpreter](http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz/)), so you can now play your favorite text adventures anywhere you go!\r\n*   [Exult](http://exult.sourceforge.net) is being merged in as a plugin, allowing Ultima 7 fans around the world to play their favorite game on the many platforms already supported by the CABAL component engines - including Palm/PocketPC PDAs and the Dreamcast.\r\n*   Revolution software has offered the source-code for Broken Sword 3, which will be added to the titles supported by the upcoming CABAL3D project - alongside with Grim Fandango and, possibly, Ultima IX (negotiations are ongoing).\r\n*   Support for the SNES games Final Fantasy IV through VI (Japanese numbering, i.e. FF2/FF3 according to US releases) is planned for sometime this Fall. Whilst these are not strictly adventure games, the storyline and plots in this series are more imaginative than any 'action adventure' title published in recent years.\r\n\r\nOffers by various companies, including Microsoft and Amiga International, to buy out the team have been gently but firmly declined by the leads of the joint project. \"We know that we could earn a lot of money from this, but we are idealists and at this time we have the goal to reform the worlds adventure market. Once that is achieved, we can reconsider about making some money out of this.\""

Over the last several days there has been heated debate regarding several important design issues, and current tension in the team has risen to an insurmountable level.\r\n\r\n\"It's really unfortunate\", Max Horn, senior developer on ScummVM and Exult, was quoted as saying, \"but \\[former FreeSCI maintainer\\] Christoph \\[Reichenbach\\]'s ideas of aligning curly braces with the left-hand side of function declarations while appending them to the end of the line for 'while' and 'for' loops did not make any sense at all.\"  \r\nThe latter replied by pointing out that \"using anything but tabs for indentation is calling for trouble.\"\r\n\r\nClaudio Matsuoka, of the Sarien project, pointed out his disappointment and noted that he didn't see much of a point in trying to co-operate with people entirely incapable of reaching agreements on such trivial issues. \"I mean, we haven't even resolved the entire EMACS vs. vi dispute, and they're already at each other's throats again.\"  \r\nJames Brown, another senior developer on the ScummVM project, sadly announced that he was laughed out of the project meer hours before a decision to split was made. \"They just said I didn't belong, since I prefer nano as a editor...\" he admitted."

This provoked quite a bit of argument within the ScummVM team as to whether this is considered an adventure and within ScummVMs goals.\r\n\r\nAfter much debate, the engine author (cyx) decided that it would be more convenient to continue the project seperate from ScummVM. It has now been removed, and future information and development will occur as part of the [RAW](http://membres.lycos.fr/cyxdown/raw/) project.

Layers should be used, and consideration taken that the majority of the design is feasibly done in HTML with minimal use of large graphical elements.\r\n*   The completed design must be designed for optimal use at 1024x768, but the page should be designed to be renderable in lower resolutions and in text-only browsers.\r\n*   The main focus should be on an easy, noticeable and uncrowded navigation system.\r\n*   Sites submitted with a completed HTML template will be considered for extra points if they obey the following extra rules. Otherwise they will be graded on design merits only.\r\n    *   Completed sites should be submitted as a one-page HTML template. All original graphics should be included (layered if applicable) in Photoshop .PSD or GIMP .XCF format.\r\n    *   Sites must have readable HTML/CSS code, and should be quick-loading and as 'light' as possible.\r\n    *   Sites should be W3C HTML4.01 verified, and have no particular browser dependencies.\r\n\r\nSubmissions close on the 21st of October, and public voting will occur after the team has selected the final candidates.

We hope to be able to deliver a nice christmas present to you this way. But for this to work out, we need your help: We need people who actively test the latest CVS so that we can iron out and fix all remaining issues with it, to ensure a high quality release.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help, check out the [release status page](http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=release) for a list of games which need testing.\r\n\r\nThat's it for today, hopefully the next time around we can announce something more substantial (like a new release or a new website).

On the upside, we have accumulated a lot to tell you about:\r\n\r\n**New Ports**\r\n\r\n*   Ports are important for us -- that much we have in common with the good ol' pirates from Monkey Island. Of course in our case it's not the wet kind (with ships and stuff), but rather ports of ScummVM to different architectures. On that front, we have some pretty nice things coming up for the next ScummVM release, including an official PlayStation 2 port, as well as the AmigaOS port now being official, too. And with some luck maybe even the often requested EPOC/Symbian port will finally be a regular part of ScummVM (take a look at the relevant [patch tracker item](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1188433&amp;group_id=37116&amp;atid=418822) if you are curious).\r\n\r\n**New games**\r\n\r\n*   We added a new game engine, this time for Coktel's Gobliiins series. So far, Gobliiins 1 is completable. Work on the other parts (Gobliins 2, Goblins 3, and \"The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble\") has not yet begun, but at least Gobliins 2 seems to be similar to part 1, so we hope to have that in the foreseeable future, too. Regarding the other parts, we'll see...\r\n*   Thanks to the hard work of some dedicated people we also finally support the (in)famous NES version of Maniac Mansion. Wow, that should be about the last LucasArts SCUMM game we were not supporting ... ;-)\r\n*   Support for Humongous Entertainment's kids games is progressing well, the following titles can be completed with the current development version of ScummVM:\r\n    *   Freddi Fish 1 - 4\r\n    *   Pajama Sam 1 &amp; 2\r\n    *   Putt-Putt (several titles)\r\n    *   Spy Fox 1 &amp; 2\r\n    *   Several arcade titles\r\n\r\n**New thumbs**\r\n\r\n*   No, I didn't undergo plastic surgery (although another pair of thumbs sounds tempting...). Rather, we added support for thumbnails in SCUMM savegames. Pretty cool stuff, click [here for a screenshot](/data/news/20050511.png).\r\n\r\nNot too shabby, we think.

In case you wonder, a versioning system is a tool for collaborative software development. As you probably know, the ScummVM Team consists of more than 30 active core developers, and many more are on our list of past and present contributors. Working on a project on this scale just would not be possible without the help of such a system.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, Ludvig Strigeus committed his initial ScummVM version to CVS, the versioning system we used until recently. Vincent Hamm joined him shortly thereafter. Since then, a lot has changed, many things have happened. We have more than 20,000 revisions of ScummVM and its various components in our CVS repository.\r\n\r\nWe now moved to a new system, Subversion. Compared to CVS, it adds many useful new features, that allow us to work more efficiently on ScummVM, something we are sure all our users will appreciate. Among other things, there will be no more lag between anonymous and developers version of the source code -- you get everything we do instantly!\r\n\r\nIf you used a CVS checkout so far, scrap it, install a [Subversion client](http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html) and checkout\r\n\r\n https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ \r\n\r\nIf you are using the command line subversion client, that means you simply have to type the following command:\r\n\r\n svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ scummvm \r\n\r\nYou will notice that the source tree of ScummVM already changed significantly and yet more is to come.

As you may know, we are widely using Interactive Disassembler from [DataRescue](http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/index.htm). So far most of us have been using the freeware version, but it has many serious limitations (which obviously makes it free). We conducted negotiations with DataRescue and received a very generous discount. We would really like to buy 5 IDA Pro licenses for several key team developers who will be able to use it at full extent. So if you would really like to see the project going steady and support for even more games added, consider to donating a couple of dollars or euros.\r\n\r\nOur target is $950 US dollars and whilst this no small goal, taking into account more that 2,5 millions downloads, 15,000+ web visitors per day and almost 5,400 registered forum users we feel that it is very achievable.

Please check our [Donor List](https://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=37116) to see how many donations we received, and to read everybody's comments.

We were contacted by someone who offered us a direct lead to Emilio de Paz from Alcachofa Soft, S.L., the software house that created this game in 1996. Finally in July '07 we received the sources and a few months later they finally freewared it and gave us an official permission distribute the game.\r\n\r\nThe original version of the game is in Spanish with full voice overs and subtitles. Then there exists an English version with full voice overs and subtitles, and finally there are subtitles in German, French and Italian. Of course, there is also a full musical score which came as a set of audio tracks on the CD (the game was CD-only). We improved the English and Italian translations, and made all that was mentioned here ready for [download](/downloads/).\r\n\r\nIn order to play the game you will need at least the English pack. Then you may optionally download the music pack, and the international pack which contains all those additional languages, Spanish included.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this will really extend the lifetime of the game and wish the best to [Alcachofa Soft](http://www.alcachofasoft.com/)."

The original founders of ScummVM, yazoo and strigeus, were still active, but soon after left ScummVM for other ventures. Ender remained as the sole project leader until March 2003, when Max \"Fingolfin\" Horn joined him at the steering wheel. The long time leading triumvirate of ScummVM was completed in April 2006 with the addition of Eugene \"sev\" Sandulenko. Together, we went through many good and bad times.\r\n\r\nEnder worked especially hard on the PR side of things, including tons of posts in the news section of this site (we **really** should post news updates more frequently again!), and many behind-the-scenes negotiations with companies regarding source code releases and other things. Not to mention repeatedly crossing swords with the legal department of LucasArts.\r\n\r\nRecently, due to personal issues, Ender has had less and less time to work on ScummVM and related things. Not wanting to harm the project by being unable to devote enough time to take care of important tasks, Ender has graciously agreed to resign his post.\r\n\r\nThe remaining project leaders, Fingolfin and Sev, would like to thank Ender for his many years of faithful leadership, and wish him all the best in his future endeavors."

Incredible work by the FreeSCI team and our own SCI engine team!\r\n\r\nEarly SCI 16-color games can be optionally undithered by ScummVM, making them look much better. To see a comparison between undithered graphics and the original, watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FScrBr16vkM) produced by one of our SCI engine developers and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nBesides SCI, we have added support for yet another Coktel Vision game called _Fascination_ and we have a number of new ports: Android, Dingux, Caanoo and OpenPandora. Unfortunately we had to declare the PalmOS port officially dead.\r\n\r\nAs usual there are tons of engine-specific bug fixes. Take a look at the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.2.0/ReleaseNotes) if you want to know more. But wait! We would like to tell a little bit about another long-awaited feature new in this release. After all these years we are finally going international, and the ScummVM GUI can be translated into any language (well, almost any). Right now we have Catalan, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian localizations. Besides this there are a lot of smaller improvements like tooltips, radio buttons, improved usability and we support more games running from original media without the need to shuffle the game files.\r\n\r\nEnough talking! Now it is time to [download](/downloads/) ScummVM and start playing!"

We have therefore come up with a modification for ScummVM that optionally removes Cedric from _King's Quest V_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being able to remove Cedric from _King's Quest V_, we have also worked on a mode for all other ScummVM games to insert Cedric into them.

The completed games need to be reported on [our forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=12392) and we will update our [release testing page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.6.0). For a usable test report, we need you to provide the version, language, and platform of the game you're testing. And, of course, please stick to the [testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).\r\n\r\nThis release also has another interesting aspect. Depending on how intensively games are tested, we will add support for one more game: _Hopkins FBI_. For support to happen, we need test results on several platforms using several variants of the game, which includes the BeOS, OS/2, Linux and Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you want _Hopkins FBI_ in ScummVM 1.6.0, grab your originals and contribute to this new testing period! We are also in need of screenshots too! Please submit them to [our patch tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&amp;atid=418822)."

Game speed for Apple IIgs is handled properly now. And it's even possible to switch to the looks of another platform.\r\n\r\nNew ports include GCW-Zero (yes, sev finally got one from the Kickstarter) and Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nAlso, along the way we have moved to a new server and added translation capabilities to our main website.

Once again, we would like to mention that auto-updating is selected as an opt-in during your first start up. By default, if you enable it, it will check weekly for new releases. Screenshots of this in action can be seen at [the WinSparkle website](https://winsparkle.org).\r\n\r\nNotable bugfixes and enhancements include Hercules rendering and font for the AGI games, numerous bugfixes to SCI games, enhanced _Sherlock_ games experience, and AmiUpdate on the Amiga port.\r\n\r\nThe full list of changes included in this release can be found in [the release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.9.0/ReleaseNotes) and the binaries are provided on our [downloads page](/downloads/).\r\n\r\nWait no more, and start playing _Myst_ or _U.F.O.s_ right now!"

        "content": "![Translation status](https://translations.scummvm.org/widgets/scummvm/-/287x66-white.png)\r\n\r\nUntil now, translating the ScummVM software was not straightforward. Contributors had to get the translations template file to their computer, update the translation using a dedicated application, and then propose the updated translation to the ScummVM team using a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) or [our bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/). The ScummVM team itself also had some manual tasks to perform, such as updating the translation templates from the source code when needed or rebuilding the binary translation file after receiving a translator's contribution.\r\n\r\nAll this belongs to the past. Now, thanks to our new [translations website](https://translations.scummvm.org/), powered by [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), updating the translations is easier and more comfortable than ever before. Translation templates are updated automatically when needed, and so is the binary translation data file. Translators now just have to translate. That's it. The website also helps translators by performing automated quality checks and suggesting (machine) translations.\r\n\r\nFinally, the new site also adds a community aspect to translations, enabling users to vote for suggested translations and even make their own suggestions. Anybody can view the translations, but you will need to log in to make suggestions, comment, and vote. You can log in using your GitHub or Facebook account, or by creating an account on the website. You will still need to contact us if you want to contribute further (for example to start a new translation or help on an existing one), as we will need to grant you access to the Translators group. Unlike regular users, translators can accept or reject suggestions and modify translations directly. Contact us by visiting the #scummvm IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or by sending an email to [translation@scummvm.org](mailto:translation@scummvm.org) if you are interested in becoming an official translator. Otherwise, head over to [https://translations.scummvm.org/](https://translations.scummvm.org/) now, and help us make ScummVM accessible to everyone."

        "content": "We are very proud to announce that Retro-Junk has been working on ScummVM support for one of the most important games of Video Game History: Plumbers Don't Wear Ties!\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, we've had a constant stream of requests asking us to investigate support for this genre-defining masterpiece. It changed the gaming industry forever, by introducing (among many other innovations) an awesome negative-filtered intro (with karting pandas), FMP as a genre game (Full Motion Pictures), and even to this day remains the only game which uses 42nd degree humour.\r\n\r\nThe engine reflects the astonishing complexity of the game, with 500 lines of code - at the time of writing, it would be one of the largest engine (62nd largest to be precise) in our tree. As you can imagine, it will take us some time to review and get it merged.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can already grab the source code from [this pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/pull/932), build a copy and play it (only PC version supported currently). And remember, we are always interested in new screenshots!\r\n\r\nWe'd also like you to join us and give a very special thank you to two of our developers, uruk-hai and t0by. They've continued to relentlessly push for support of this game, keeping everyone motivated. This work may not have been possible without them!\r\n\r\nBefore you start your test run, we encourage you to read through our [testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing), and please take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) along the way.\r\n\r\nNow, go! Grab your copy of the game and the code, and enjoy this historical moment!\r\n\r\n**Update:** If you thought it was an April Fool's Day joke, you have been trolled. The Pull Request on GitHub is genuine, and ScummVM will really support _Plumbers Don't Wear Ties_ if it gets merged."

        "content": "**Update:** we were unable to reserve the plumbervm.org domain and thus, with a heavy heart, we decided to abandon our rebranding effort and go back to our old name. Long live ScummVM!\r\n\r\nThe issue of the name of ScummVM has been raised many times since we started to add engines for non-SCUMM games. Until now we decided to keep the original name. However, the addition today of an engine for _Plumbers Don't Wear Ties_ changes everything. Due to its fame and reputation for being one of the best video game ever, it naturaly becomes the flagship of what we stand for. Thus we have finally decided to change our name. We are now **PlumberVM**!\r\n\r\nWe used the name ScummVM for over 15 years, and this is with sadness that we say goodbye to it. It is a well known name and we do not underestimate the effort it will take to get the same recognition for our new name. Thus we are calling on your help to spread the news. In the short term this will inevitably lead to some disruption and confusion. But in the long term we are convinced that this is the right decision. With your support we will conquer the world! Starting from the sewers.\r\n\r\nWith the change of name we have also decided to expand even more the scope of our project. Last year we decided to accept engines for RPG games in addition to adventure games. Now we are also accepting any games that feature a plumber. Work has already started on the little known _Super Mario Bros._, and we have big plans for the future. We will have a big announcement soon, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\nOn a final note, it will take time for us to update all the places where our name appears. We have started today with our main website and you will notice in the next few days the change spreading to our social media accounts, wiki, forum and the pages not yet updated on our web site. We are also working on releasing PlumberVM 2.0 with the addition of two new supported games: _Plumbers Don't Wear Ties_ and _Full Pipe_. This will happen as soon as the last few bugs in our engines for _Plumbers Don't Wear Ties_ and _Full Pipe_ have been squashed. Hopefully we won't find mutant turtles during testing. Squashing those is a real pain!"

        "content": "![GSoC Logo](/data/news/GSoC2017Logo.png)\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, Google announced the organizations that have been accepted for this year's Summer of Code, and we are very pleased to announce that ScummVM is one of them, together with our sister project ResidualVM. The Summer of Code is a yearly event organized by Google to encourage students to contribute to open source projects. Open source organizations provide mentors and projects to work on, while Google give some money to participating students. You can find more information on the [official web site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). We also have some information on [our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code), and in particular [project rules](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/Project_Rules) that applicants will need to follow.\r\n\r\nAre you a motivated student? Are you available between May 14 and August 6? Do you want to be a contributor to one of the largest game preservation projects? Then ScummVM and ResidualVM are waiting for you! Have a look at [our ideas page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2018) or bring your own idea! Students have until March 27 to write and submit proposals for the project they want to work on. The accepted proposals will be announced on April 23, and there will be a few weeks for community bonding before the start of the 12 week coding period on May 14.\r\n\r\nIn any case, don't hesitate to chat with us on IRC! One place: Freenode. Two channels: #scummvm and #residualvm"

        "title": "IDA Disassembler",
        "content": "A recent discussion about the most recent IDA Disassembler freeware 7.0 revealed that it no longer supports disassembling older DOS and Windows executables. This is obviously a problem for potential contributors, as well as potential GSoC students wanting to reverse engineer an old adventure game or RPG for their project. The obvious solution is to provide an earlier freeware version that still supports them.\r\n\r\nConsulting with Hex-Rays, they're kindly consented for us to host one of the earlier IDA freeware versions, for those in the future who wish to use it. After reviewing the earlier versions, we've settled on [IDA Freeware Version 5.0](https://www.scummvm.org/frs/extras/IDA/idafree50.exe). IDA 5.0 was the first version of IDA that added the convenient graph view, and this freeware version has both it as well as the ability to disassemble DOS executables. It's also not time limited like the demo versions, it's the most convenient for enthusiasts to try their hand at reverse engineering old games.\r\n\r\nConsidering how many of our game engines have been created by reverse engineering the original games, hopefully we will continue to see people interested in re-implementing games in the future.\r\n\r\nThe more the merrier :)"

You'll also need an extra required [xeen.ccs](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/dists/engine-data/xeen.ccs?raw=true) file, which should be put in the same folder you copy your game files to.\r\n\r\nBefore you start testing any of the games, please be aware that given the large part combat plays in the game, any errors you encounter may be more difficult to replicate than in traditional adventure games. As such, it'll be a good idea to make a practice of regularly saving your game, just in case something goes wrong. If you do experience any crashes, or notice any functionality which seems incorrect, please let us know. Any problems found should be reported on our [Issue Tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/)."
