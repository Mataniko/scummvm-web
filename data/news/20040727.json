    "content": "ScummVM 0.6.1 is out, and can now be grabbed from our download page!  \nAmong the usual changes, ScummVM should now run natively on 64-bit machines -- something we actually forgot to mention in the NEWS file.\n\nAnd you know what they say: \"To save the world, you have to push a few old ladies down the stairs.\" So we made a mother-load of fixes in this release. Some of the wonderful things you will no LONGER see in ScummVM include:\n\n*   Glitches using an Ogg Vorbis talkie file in some games\n*   Crashes on 64-bit machines\n*   Crashes when saving to an invalid directory in Broken Sword 1\n*   Lots of sound glitches in Curse of Monkey Island, Full Throttle and The Dig\n*   Crashes in some international versions of Simon the Sorcerer\n*   ... and lots of other annoying bugs!\n\nSo don't delay, download today. Downloads are not yet available for all supported ports, such as non-ARM PocketPCs and the HandheldPC binaries. These should become available within the next week.",
