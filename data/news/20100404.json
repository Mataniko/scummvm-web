    "content": "Another 4 months passed, a lot of hard work done... and finally it is here: ScummVM 1.1.0 is available now on our [downloads page](/downloads/).\n\nThere are some pretty exciting new features: We added support for 16bit graphics, which allowed us to add support for a whole bunch of newer Humongous Entertainment games for kids. We also added or improved support for the Amiga versions of _Monkey Island_, _Legend of Kyrandia_ and _Future Wars_. Plus there are **two completely new engines** for the games _Dragon History_ (available for free from [here](http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/index-en.html)) and _TeenAgent_ (available for free from [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/en/frontpage/?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d)). And finally there is now **a port for the Nintendo 64** game console!\n\nTake a look at the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.1.0/ReleaseNotes) if you want to know a bit more.\n\nThere is one grain of salt, though: If you want to play _Nippon Safes Inc_, we recommend that you stick with your current ScummVM version for now, as there are some nasty regressions in there which may even make it impossible to complete the game. Also the background music in _Pajama Sam 1_ isn't working correctly in the Kitchen and Mine areas anymore.\n\nWe are not happy about that, but in the end decided that we should not let this hold up the other new cool stuff we added. Instead, we will follow up this release in about four weeks with a 1.1.1 release that should fix these issues. In fact, you can help us make 1.1.1 even better by [reporting any bugs](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) you might encounter in 1.1.0.\n\nAnd now go and get it while it's still hot from our [downloads page](/downloads/), grab a build for your favorite device and have fun :).",
