While Upthorn's project didn't last the summer, we have a pull request which adds much-improved support for saving games to the composer engine.\n\nThe next and final step for this year of GSoC is the mentor summit, where ScummVM will be represented again by sev and Strangerke.\n\nWe'd like to thank once again Google for their organization, their support and for accepting us this year again. ScummVM made a great step forward thanks to them, once again!\n\nWe'd also like to warmly thank Jakimushka, Singron, Somaen and Upthorn for working this summer with us, with a special mention for Somaen who decided to keep working for ScummVM on Wintermute. We hope that some of the others might do so too!",
