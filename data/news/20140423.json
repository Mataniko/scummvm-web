They will be mentoring three students:\n\n*   Stefano Musumeci (a.k.a. subr3v) will be working on refactoring and optimizing the **_TinyGL software renderer_**.\n*   Joni Vδhδmδki (a.k.a. Akz) and Joseph Jezak (a.k.a. JoseJX) will both be working on improving the **_Escape from Monkey Island_** engine, tackling bugs and missing features from two different angles.\n\nWe expect it will be a productive and interesting summer!",
