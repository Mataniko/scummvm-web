However, after discussing with our sister project ResidualVM, we are happy to announce that, this year, we will also be accepting RPG tasks.\n\nScummVM and ResidualVM are now waiting for motivated students, willing to work during this summer on reviving adventure and role-playing games.\n\nBe part of it! Make History and join our best GSoC so far! Take a look at [our ideas page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2016) or bring your own idea, then contact us: we are waiting for you on IRC impatiently!\n\nOne place: Freenode. Two channels: #scummvm and #residualvm",
