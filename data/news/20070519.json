    "content": "Hello there ScummVM users! It's that time of year again where we ask you to test your games while we gear up for a new release, and this time it's for 0.10.0. While the official Big Testing Season(TM) begins on May 23, we ask that you begin testing games now, except for AGOS games (_Simon the Sorcerer_ series, _Feeble Files_) and _Nippon Safes_.\n\nThere are several new games for 0.10.0 including _Touche: The Adventure of the Fifth Musketeer_ and _Future Wars_. In addition, DrMcCoy has been extra busy and dealt us _Gobliins 2_, _Goblins 3_, _Ween: The Prophecy_ and _Bargon Attack_. Also, _Nippon Safes_ will be included in this release. This release will also feature the AGI games from the merge with Sarien.\n\nThere are detailed instructions on how to perform testing in a helpful way. You will find them at our [Wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing). Please, stick to those and report on our mailing list, on #scummvm or in [our forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=22358). The current list of tested games can be found [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/0.10.0).",
