    "content": "<p>Last year, we added support for three of Sierra's Hi-Res Adventure games: <i>Mystery House</i> (#1), <i>Mission: Asteroid</i> (#0) and <i>Wizard and the Princess</i> (#2). We're proud to announce that three more Apple II games are now playable in ScummVM and ready for testing: <i>Ulysses and the Golden Fleece</i> (#4), <i>Time Zone</i> (#5) and <i>The Dark Crystal</i> (#6).</p><p>For <i>Ulysses and the Golden Fleece</i>, we currently support the Load 'N' Go budget release. For <i>Time Zone</i> and <i>The Dark Crystal</i> we support the disk images that can be found on some of the <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCI/Game_Collections\">Sierra collection CDs</a>. The <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles\">Datafiles wiki page</a> has been updated with the required filenames for the disk images.</p><p>If you own one of those classics, grab the latest <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> and try it out! If you encounter an issue, please post a bug report following our <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing\">testing guidelines</a>. And while you're at it, please take some <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots\">screenshots!</a></p><p>You may be wondering what happened to <i>Hi-Res Adventure #3: Cranston Manor</i>. Unfortunately, we still have not been able to locate a copy of this game after looking for it for over a year. If you own it, we'd love to <a href=\"/contact/\">hear from you</a>!</p>",
