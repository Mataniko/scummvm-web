We have an explanation of the proper way to do so [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) in our wiki.\n\nSo, if you've got a few minutes, an interesting save in the middle of a game, and you want to help, please feel free to take and submit a screenshot of it. As the wiki states, ScummVM should be in HQ2x mode with aspect ratio correction ON.",
