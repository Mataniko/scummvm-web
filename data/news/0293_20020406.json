    "content": "After some work, the 256 color CD Talkie version of Loom is completable! With this done, we are starting to gear up for a 0.2.0 release. To help us with this, we ask you - our game players - to take the latest Daily Builds and CVS snapshots and play through your favorite games!<br /> We need to make sure that the following games are completable with no major playability bugs (eg, crashes, freezes, etc - minor issues such as sound syncro do not count):<ul><li>Loom CD</li><li>Monkey Island 1 (CD)</li><li>Monkey Island 2</li><li>Indy 4: Fate of atlantis</li><li>Sam and Max</li><li>Day of the Tentacle</li></ul>Thanks a lot, and we hope everything will work just fine so we can finally get a new release out the door! Also, by popular demand, 0.2.0 will include a new 'auto-save' feature to ensure you'll never lose hours of hard work because you forgot to save and suddenly found a bug!",
