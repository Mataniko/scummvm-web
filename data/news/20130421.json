    "content": "Greetings, fellow adventure gamers! We have finally come to the point when ScummVM 1.6.0 testing starts.\n\nThis release adds support for a number of new games that need to be tested:\n\n*   _3 Skulls of the Toltecs_\n*   _Eye of the Beholder_\n*   _Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon_\n*   _Hopkins FBI_\n*   _Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths_\n*   _The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime_\n\nIn addition, if you have Macintosh version of _Discworld_, please give it a try as well.\n\nA [daily build](/downloads/#daily) should be used for testing these, and if something goes unexpectedly wrong, please report it to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). The completed games need to be reported on [our forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=12392) and we will update our [release testing page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.6.0). For a usable test report, we need you to provide the version, language, and platform of the game you're testing. And, of course, please stick to the [testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).\n\nThis release also has another interesting aspect. Depending on how intensively games are tested, we will add support for one more game: _Hopkins FBI_. For support to happen, we need test results on several platforms using several variants of the game, which includes the BeOS, OS/2, Linux and Windows versions.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want _Hopkins FBI_ in ScummVM 1.6.0, grab your originals and contribute to this new testing period! We are also in need of screenshots too! Please submit them to [our patch tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&atid=418822).",
