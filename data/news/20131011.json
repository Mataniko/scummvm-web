    "content": "On the 9th of October 2001, the very first commit was made to a CVS repository and thus the ScummVM project was born...\n\nAs I write this post, it is now the 11th of October 2013 and we have over 58000 commits in the ScummVM Git repository... but still based on that initial commit over a decade ago!\n\nThus on the project's 12th anniversary, I believed ScummVM deserved a present... Thus myself, James Woodcock and the ScummVM PR Team present \"ScummVM: THE MOVIE\"! :)\n\nThis visualization is powered by [Gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/).If you want to play with this yourself or render a full length HD version, then you can find the scripts to do this [here](https://github.com/digitall/scummvm-the-movie).\n\nSo get the popcorn and enjoy!",
