Sadly, he decided to quit before the end of his tasks, but his code was of such good quality that it is now merged into master, so ScummVM benefits from his work.\n\nEnginmanap worked on objectifying the CruisE engine. He did a great job, and his work is currently being polished before a final merge into master.\n\nWe were also represented at the mentor summit by sev and Strangerke.\n\nWe are really grateful to Google for all of their support, and are already working on GSoC 2012 tasks.",
