    "content": "\"You are in the front yard of a large, abandoned Victorian house.\"\n\nYou can now experience adventure game history, and play Sierra's early _Hi-Res Adventure #1: Mystery House_ in ScummVM. Dare you leap back to 1980 and take the steps up to the porch? Grab the game and a [daily build](/downloads/#daily), and join our testing by stepping back in time.\n\nWe're proud to announce that we now also have support for several other games using the same ADL system â€” which feature advanced technologies such as color graphics! Perhaps you'd rather save the planet (_Hi-Res Adventure #0: Mission Asteroid_), or save the princess ( _Hi-Res Adventure #2: The Wizard and the Princess_)?\n\nWe're working on the rest of the _Hi-Res Adventure_ games, but in the meantime, we're releasing support for the Apple II versions of these three games for testing, and look forward to seeing any bug reports for problems you might find. We'd like to include these in our next release, so be sure to read through our [testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing), and don't forget to take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).\n\n_Mystery House_ was released into the public domain by Sierra On-Line in 1987, to celebrate their 7th anniversary. You can [download it](https://www.scummvm.org/games/#mysthous) for free. For more details about the other games and where you might be able to buy a copy, take a peek at [our wiki pages](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/ADL).\n\nIf you happen to have original floppies for any of the _Hi-Res Adventure_ games (for any platform), we want to hear from you. In particular, if you have an Apple II version of _Hi-Res Adventure #3: Cranston Manor_, please get in touch. Many of these games are rare, and we cannot add support for all the different releases without your help!",
