    "content": "A year has passed and ScummVM 1.7.0 is here.\n\nWith this release we have added support for 5 completely new games. These are:\n\n*   _The Neverhood_\n*   _Mortville Manor_\n*   _Voyeur_\n*   _Return to Ringworld_\n*   _Chivalry is Not Dead_\n\nAlso, we have updated the MT-32 emulator, added an OpenGL backend, improved many aspects of the GUI, enhanced the AGOS engine, made _Urban Runner_'s videos less CPU-demanding, fixed tons of bugs in dozens of SCI games, improved sound in _Loom_ and _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ and improved platform portability for the Tony and Tinsel engines.\n\nBut this is not all. We have added experimental support for the OUYA console (we couldn't add GCW-Zero support simply because sev _still_ awaits his console from [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gcw/gcw-zero-open-source-gaming-handheld/posts)), made major improvements to the PS2 port and merged the Bada with Tizen ports.\n\nThe full list with all changes mentioned can be found in [our release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.7.0/ReleaseNotes) and the release can be obtained as usual from our [downloads page](/downloads/).\n\nEverybody Way Oh!",
