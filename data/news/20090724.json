    "content": "[![CCA 2009 Mascot](/data/news/20090724.png)](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/) Earlier today, ScummVM won the SourceForge.net Community Choice Awards 2009 award for 'Best Project for Gamers'.\n\nThe main [Sourceforge.net: Community Hub](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/) hasn't yet been updated, but if you go to the [Choice Awards 2009 Live Party](http://ccalive.com/) website, you can see the results in the 'The Winners' box. It's certainly a nice way to celebrate ScummVM moving to its long awaited version 1.0 with this award as well.",
