    "content": "After a very long break, we are finally starting preparations for our next release, ScummVM 1.8.0.\n\nThe last one year and a half have been very busy, and we added 10 (ten, zehn, dieci, dix, diez, десять) new games:\n\n*   _Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender_\n*   _Sfinx_\n*   _Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands_\n*   _Zork: Grand Inquisitor_\n*   _The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel_\n*   _The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Rose Tattoo_\n*   _Beavis and Butthead in Virtual Stupidity_\n*   _Amazon: Guardians of Eden_\n*   _Broken Sword 2.5: The Return of the Templars_\n*   _Labyrinth of Time_\n\nAlso, we had a major rewrite of the AGI engine, so all AGI games should work better, but could also have new, unexpected bugs.\n\nThus, we need your help with testing out these games, including AGI-based ones. For your convenience, we gathered together what requires testing on [our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.8.0). There are also a few other old classics on that list that could use another run through.\n\nYou need to grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and you may start helping right away! If you happen to find any bugs, please report them on our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). After completing one of the games, please let us know on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=14006) so we can mark your progress on the [wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.8.0) and other players can concentrate on untested games. Please be sure to follow our guidelines for release testing, which can be found [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).\n\nAlso some of these games require [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots), which you can make along your gameplay.\n\nHappy adventuring (in a test mode)!",
