    "content": "<p>Greetings, citizens. The OmiBrain facility ScummVM Team needs you to do game testing.</p><p>As usual, we prepared many new features for you and killed zillions of bugs. That means that every supported game needs retesting.</p><p>There are 2 completely new games which we introduce in 0.9.0. The Legend of Kyrandia and The Feeble Files. Also there are few Humongous Entertainment games where compatibility bumped significantly, Pajama Sam 3 is among them. So, please, find your old game media or buy some more and enjoy the gameplay of these classics.</p><p>There are detailed instructions on how to perform testing in a helpful way. You will find them at our <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing\">Wiki page</a>. Note, that the guidelines have changed a bit since last Big Testing Season(TM) which you performed for 0.8.0. Please, stick to those and report on our mailing list, on #scummvm or in <a href=\"http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=1502\">our forums</a>.</p><p>Have a nice cycle, and remember: The OmniBrain loves you!</p>",
