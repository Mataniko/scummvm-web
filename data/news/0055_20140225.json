The world may never know, but we are thrilled to be accepted again and welcome fellow students to join our team and work on awesome 2D point-and-click adventures. If you are an eligible student for the GSoC and want to contribute to your favorite open-source project, take a look at <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GSoC_Ideas\">our project ideas</a>, but you always can offer your own.</p><p>But, please, no Digger support: it's not an adventure!</p>",
