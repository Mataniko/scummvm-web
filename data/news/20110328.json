    "content": "We're pleased to announce that the next release of ScummVM will have support for several [\"Living Books\"](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Mohawk/Games#Living_Books_Series) games! It's time to relive your childhood memories (or memories of your children!) and dust off the old discs. The (sadly) now grown-up ScummVM team no longer has all of these games lying around, so we need _your_ help in testing the games to weed out any remaining bugs.\n\nThe first batch of supported Living Books games consists of _Just Grandma and Me_ (v1), _Arthur's Teacher Trouble_, _Aesop's Fables: The Tortoise and the Hare_, _Ruff's Bone_, _The New Kid on the Block_, _Arthur's Birthday_ (v1), _Little Monster at School_, _Harry and the Haunted House_, _The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight_, _Dr. Seuss's ABC_, _Sheila Rae, the Brave_, _The Berenstain Bears in the Dark_, _Stellaluna_, and most of _Green Eggs and Ham_. We hope to support the rest of the games in the future, but in the meantime, we hope that these are enough to keep our loyal users occupied.\n\nBe sure to grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) when testing. If you spot any bugs while enjoying these classic interactive stories or even just complete one, we'd really like to know over on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10097). Be sure to drink your ovaltine post them to the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/); and keep those [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) in mind. And if anyone happens to take a few [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) before nap time and wishes to submit them, we would be eternally grateful.",
