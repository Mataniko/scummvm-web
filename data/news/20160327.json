    "content": "You stumble upon an old handwritten book. It describes an island world named Myst. When you touch one of its last pages, you are transported to the island. As you explore Myst you learn about its inhabitants Atrus, Catherine and their sons Sirrus and Achenar. You quickly discover each son is trapped in a book. Will you solve the puzzles of the Myst ages and free them?\n\nThe ScummVM Team is proud to announce that _Myst_ and _Myst: Masterpiece Edition_ are now playable in ScummVM using the [latest daily builds](/downloads/#daily), and are ready for testing.\n\nReports of bugs and unknown versions are appreciated.
