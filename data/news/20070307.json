    "content": "[_Bargon Attack_](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Bargon_Attack), which like _Ween: The Prophecy_ shares most of the code with _Gobliins 2_, is now completable and supported. Hence, we ask you to catch up with the Bargonians and hunt for bugs along the way.\n\nThe procedure is the same as the last few times: take your copy of Bargon Attack and a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. Be sure you read the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) and enter any bugs into [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/).\n\nSome screenshots would be nice, too.\n\nOh, and check out Ender's speech at LCA2007 [here](http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/tuesday/tuesday_1650_gaming.ogg).",
