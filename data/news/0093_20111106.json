Sadly, he decided to quit before the end of his tasks, but his code was of such good quality that it is now merged into master, so ScummVM benefits from his work.</p><p>Enginmanap worked on objectifying the CruisE engine. He did a great job, and his work is currently being polished before a final merge into master.</p><p>We were also represented at the mentor summit by sev and Strangerke.</p><p>We are really grateful to Google for all of their support, and are already working on GSoC 2012 tasks.</p>",
