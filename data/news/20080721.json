    "title": "Another Big Testing Season!",
    "content": "It's that event that occurs about twice a year in which we ask you, our loyal users, to go out and replay all your favorite games supported by ScummVM. In addition to all the games supported from 0.11.1, we have several new ones for you. _The Bizarre Adventure of Woodruff and the Schnibble_, _Lost in Time_, _The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate_, _The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Three: Malcolm's Revenge_, and _Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back_ have support added since then. Furthermore, the DOS version of _Waxworks_ and the Macintosh version of _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_ are now supported.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go out and start testing! Grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and run through the games and note any bugs you see on the way (which you should post on the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/)). Once done, post that you've completed the game on the [forum post](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=5975) so it can be posted on the [wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/0.12.0). Be sure to list the version of the game, language, and platform.\n\nGood luck, and remember: have fun!",
