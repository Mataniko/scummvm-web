In addition to the two new games for this release, _Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos_ and _Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch_, we have a few other games that need testing. Please take a look at [our wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.4.0) to see which games need a playthrough.\n\nAs with all release testing, you'll need a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) to get started. If you happen to find any bugs, please report them on the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). Once you complete one of the games, please let us know on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10901) so we can throw the results up on the [wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.4.0). Further information can be found in the [release testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).\n\nAnd Strangerke would like to remind you to grab a couple of screenshots of _Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos_ and _Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch_ for us and submit them according to our [guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).",
