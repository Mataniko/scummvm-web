    "content": "Grim Fandango was created on the peak of LucasArts games popularity. The ever-inspirational Tim Schafer in a fury of artistry packed together the best atmosphere he could create and the game was born. For a while there was great and steady efforts on creating an engine which would run this masterpiece on the modern hardware. The project is called [ResidualVM](http://residualvm.org).\n\nAfter more than 9 years of hard work, our \"sister\" project, [ResidualVM](http://residualvm.org) has reached a stable state and is now announcing their first stable release.\n\nWe survived the apocalypse! Let's celebrate that: grab your original of Grim Fandango and visit their site!",
