    "content": "The blazingly fast addition of [_Goblins 3_](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Goblins_3) was gracefully performed thanks to the not-so-big differences from _Gobliins 2_.\n\nFor you, an average peasa... adventurer, that means that **YOU** can reach an agreement between King Bodd and Queen Xina.\n\nWill you succeed? Find out by grabbing your old copy of _Goblins 3_ from your dusty shelves, combining it with a shiny new [ScummVM 0.10.0svn](/downloads/#daily) (check the build date, it has to be after April 21, 2007, yes, 2007).\n\nRead our [bug submissions guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) and enter any bugs into [the bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/).\n\nP.S.: Please make a couple of screenshots along the way. The screenshots submission guidelines are [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).",
