Now all your fan translations will work out of the box\n*   Added subtitle configuration controls to the options dialog\n*   New official Atari/MiNT port\n*   Much improved WinCE port\n*   Numerous bugfixes in the SCUMM, SAGA, Simon, Broken Sword 2 and BASS engines\n\nFor the complete list [read the release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.9.0/ReleaseNotes).\n\nUnfortunately not all ports are built yet and also you may experience some problems with downloads as not all SourceForge mirrors picked up the files. So, please, try different mirrors and be patient.\n\nDon't wait any longer, go and fetch a build for your platform on our [downloads page](/downloads/).",
