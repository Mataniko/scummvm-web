    "content": "<p>Many thanks to Alcachofa Soft for releasing as freeware their previously commercial game: <i>Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back</i>.</p><p>It was quite a lengthy process which started in November of 2005. We were contacted by someone who offered us a direct lead to Emilio de Paz from Alcachofa Soft, S.L., the software house that created this game in 1996. Finally in July '07 we received the sources and a few months later they finally freewared it and gave us an official permission distribute the game.</p><p>The original version of the game is in Spanish with full voice overs and subtitles. Then there exists an English version with full voice overs and subtitles, and finally there are subtitles in German, French and Italian. Of course, there is also a full musical score which came as a set of audio tracks on the CD (the game was CD-only). We improved the English and Italian translations, and made all that was mentioned here ready for <a href=\"/downloads/\">download</a>.</p><p>In order to play the game you will need at least the English pack. Then you may optionally download the music pack, and the international pack which contains all those additional languages, Spanish included.</p><p>We hope that this will really extend the lifetime of the game and wish the best to <a href=\"http://www.alcachofasoft.com/\">Alcachofa Soft</a>.</p>",
