Most of the ScummVM team is very busy with real-life school and work at the moment, but we are hoping the worst will be over very soon and we can get down to crunching some more bugs and releasing a new version! Here is a very rough draft of what we are considering to be ScummVM milestones:\n\n*   0.2.5: All supported games next to bugless\n*   0.3.0: The Dig and MI1 VGA Floppy supported\n*   0.4.0: Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade supported, more bugfixes\n*   0.5.0: Full Throttle supported, basic CMI and Maniac Mansion support\n*   0.6.0: More work on CMI, MM and further bugfixes\n*   0.7.0: Maniac Mansion completable, Zak McCracken and Loom16 playable\n*   0.8.0: Zak McCracken and Loom16 completable\n*   0.9.0: Bugfixes and CMI completable\n*   1.0.0: The end of the beginning\n\nObviously this is a very rough outline, and is subject to change if we suddenly make a break-through in a game. But this is just to give people a basic idea of where we are going. CMI support will be the hardest, as it is quite drastically different compared to the versions of SCUMM we have been dealing with to this point. Happy adventuring!",
