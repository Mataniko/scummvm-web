Almost every aspect of the program was touched, tuned, altered. So we once again need to ask for testers of every game we support.</p><p>We'd like to mention two completely new titles we support now. They are Inherit the Earth and Gobliiins (first one in the series). Please, pay attention to those too.</p><p>Instructions on how to do the testing are located at our <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing\">Wiki page</a>. Please, stick to those and report on our mailing list, on #scummvm or in our forums.</p>",
