    "content": "![GSoC Logo](/data/news/GSoC2017Logo.png)\n\nToday Google announced the accepted projects for this year's Summer of Code. We are pleased to say that ScummVM will be mentoring two wizard students who will have one mission: casting the Super Sludge Nova spell. Effects include adding support for two new engines, and the cooldown period is 12 weeks:\n\n*   Joseph-Eugene Winzer (a.k.a. Joefish) will be working on adding support for the **_[Mission Supernova](http://outpost.simplicity.de)_** game.\n*   Simei Yin will work on porting the **_[Sludge engine](https://opensludge.github.io)_** to ScummVM.\n\nWe extend a warm welcome to our students for what we hope will be a productive and interesting summer! You can follow their progress throughout the summer on the [ScummVM Blogs](http://planet.scummvm.org).",
