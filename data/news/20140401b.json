    "content": "**Happy April Fools' Day! Unfortunately, we haven't really got a new developer... though pull requests are welcome!**\n\nWe do not normally announce new developers here, but we have an unusual and talented developer recently join the team, Edward Snowden.\n\nWhen we first got the e-mail from a dot-ru address which we will not be disclosing, we were skeptical.\n\nHowever upon verifying his PGP key, we are convinced that this is not some kind of April Fools joke and are happy to welcome a talented software developer with enthusiasm to the team.\n\nHe is apparently a big fan of point and click adventures, especially _Beneath a Steel Sky,_, _Dreamweb_, _Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth_, and _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_. His collection allowed him to pass a long stopover at an airport last year and he decided then, once he had sorted some personal issues to get around to contributing some code to ScummVM.\n\nAs an avid fan of Larry Niven, he will be initially working on the TSaGE support for _Return to Ringworld_ along with Strangerke, and will be using the nickname \"crazyeddie\"\n\nPlease can we ask the other developers and users not to bother him about any issues outside of ScummVM and not to send any irrelevant e-mails to his ScummVM address at \"crazyeddie@scummvm.org\" Thanks!",
