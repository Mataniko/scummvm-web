    "content": "We are very excited to announce support for ScummVM on Linux using Kinect!\n\nThrough the tireless efforts of a few coders, Strangerke, LordHoto, and Hkz, they have managed to come up with an amazing per-game gesture system. This new Kinect input system recognizes player input and translates it to mouse and keyboard presses which are then processed by the game engine. Unfortunately, this currently only works with the Kinect for Linux drivers.\n\nThe code is still very much a work-in-progress, but we've put up some screenshots of various developers testing out their favorite games in ScummVM. Here's [ST testing out _Backyard Soccer_](/data/news/20110401_1.jpg), [myself playing _Full Throttle_](/data/news/20110401_2.jpg), [Hkz playing _Gabriel Knight_](/data/news/20110401_3.jpg), and [DrMcCoy playing _Urban Runner_](/data/news/20110401_4.jpg).\n\nStay tuned for more info and a daily build should be expected within the next few days! :)\n\n**Happy April Fools' Day!**",
