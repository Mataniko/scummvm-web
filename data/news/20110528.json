    "content": "It has been longer than usual since the last release. Nevertheless the team is happy to announce the release of ScummVM 1.3.0.\n\nThe release is truly feature-rich: in particular we are introducing support for a new platform, WebOS, and adding a set of new games: _Urban Runner_, _Playtoons_, _Toonstruck_, _Hugo_ series, _Living Books_, _Backyard Baseball_. We have also continued to work hard on the SCI engine, so Amiga and some Macintosh versions of the games are supported now too. Many of our ports received improvements, and a number of bugs have been fixed in practically every engine. Thus your gameplay should be smoother and more enjoyable.\n\nAs usual, the release can be found on our [downloads page](/downloads/) and [full release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.3.0/ReleaseNotes) are also available.",
