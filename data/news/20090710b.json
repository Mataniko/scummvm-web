That's right, **1.0.0**!\n\nFor this release, we have added support for a bunch of new games: _Cruise for a Corpse_, _Discworld_, _Discworld 2 - Missing Presumed ...!?_, _Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2_, _The Manhole_, _Return to Zork_, and _Rodney's Funscreen_.\n\nAs usual, go grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM, play through the games and submit any bugs you see along the way to the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). When you complete a game, report it on the [forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=7599) so we can add it to our [release testing wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.0.0). Be sure to provide the version, language, and platform of the game you're testing (in addition to the name of course). You can find more details on testing [over here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).",
