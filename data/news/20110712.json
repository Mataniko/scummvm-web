    "title": "ScummVM 1.3.1 \"All Your Pitches\" Released!",
    "content": "We are proud to announce a maintenance release of the ScummVM 1.3.x series. This release has a number of fixes, mainly related to audio. Also, several games had slipped past testing for 1.3.0 and turned out to be no longer completable. They have now been fixed, so if you want to play _Discworld_, _Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb_, _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_, or play FM-TOWNS SCUMM games on mobile devices or consoles, we highly recommend that you upgrade.\n\nThe release can be found on our [downloads page](/downloads/) and [full release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.3.1/ReleaseNotes) are also available from our site.\n\nEnjoy!",
