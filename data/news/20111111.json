    "title": "ScummVM 1.4.0 \"10th Anniversary\" Released!",
    "content": "It has been over 10 years. We are here thanks to the work of 131 developers. 49,124 commits were made just to the ScummVM tree and those turned into a massive 1,085,714 lines of code (excluding comments) and of course over 7.6 million downloads from the main site alone. I would say those were a great ten years.\n\nThe outcome is ScummVM 1.4.0 which we are releasing today, 11/11/11 11:11:11.11.\n\nMore games are supported: _Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos_(based on the same engine as Kyrandia), the kids' game _Blue's Birthday Adventure_, and the science fiction game _Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch_. On top of that, practically all supported Sierra SCI games now have their Amiga versions working. Our musically inclined users will notice PC speaker support in _Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge_ and _Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis_, CMS support in _Loom_, _The Secret of Monkey Island_ and _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_, fixed MIDI in the DOS versions of the Elvira series, and even sound in _Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood_!\n\nAs always, there are many more new features; you can find the full list in [our release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.4.0/ReleaseNotes) and the release itself on our [downloads page](/downloads/).\n\nEnjoy!",
